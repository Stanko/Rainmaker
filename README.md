Rainmaker
===========

jQuery Weather Widget<br/>
Powered by Google weather api<br/>
Version 1.0<br/>
You can use and abuse it :)<br/>
Soon live demo...



What is it:
-----------
Rainmaker displays current weather conditions and the four day forecast for the selected cities. 
If multiple cities are selected, select box will be shown. It gets weather information from Google weather api via php file.
Of course you can use language of your choice to provide xml from Google api (can't get it directly due the cross domain AJAX). 

How it works:
-------------
Rainmaker uses google-weather.php to get XML file from Google weather api for selected cities and language. 
Then XML file is parsed and weather information is displayed, using Ajax requests which are done by jQuery.

How to install:
---------------
* Copy whole 'rainmaker' folder somewhere in your hosting.
* Be sure to have jQuery.
* Edit page where you want to put widget and insert:

`<div id="rainmaker"></div>`

(Note that widget itself is 180px wide and floats left. 
(Fully customizable via CSS.)

* Put this in header of your page


	<link href="rainmaker/rainmaker.css" rel="stylesheet"  type="text/css" />
	<script type="text/javascript" src="rainmaker/rainmaker.js"></script>
